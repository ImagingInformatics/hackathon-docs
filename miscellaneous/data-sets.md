# Openly available datasets

## [SIIM Hackathon Dataset](https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/hackathon-dataset) 
A small but comprehensive dataset featuring fictional, but realistic, patient personas with their clinical data in FHIR and images in DICOM that coraborate each patient's story.
**Note:** If you are using the [Hackathon Server](../getting-started/hackathon-server.md) then it already has this data loaded.

## [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/)
TCIA is a service which de-identifies and hosts a large archive of medical images of cancer accessible for public download. The data are organized as “Collections”, typically patients related by a common disease (e.g. lung cancer), image modality (MRI, CT, etc) or research focus. DICOM is the primary file format used by TCIA for image storage. Supporting data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics, pathology, and expert analyses are also provided when available.

## [Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons)
IDC connects researchers with publicly available cancer imaging data, often linked with other types of cancer data, and co-located with cloud-based computational resources and big data analysis tools provided by the Google Cloud Platform. IDC will provide the tools to search and visualize cancer imaging data, define cohorts and use those cohorts for cloud-based analysis to better understand the disease and evaluate treatment options.

## [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge](https://challenge2020.isic-archive.com/)
This **Dermatology** dataset contains 33,126 dermoscopic training images of unique benign and malignant skin lesions from over 2,000 patients. Each image is associated with one of these individuals using a unique patient identifier. All malignant diagnoses have been confirmed via histopathology, and benign diagnoses have been confirmed using either expert agreement, longitudinal follow-up, or histopathology. A thorough publication describing all features of this dataset is available in the form of a pre-print that has not yet undergone peer review.

The dataset was generated by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) and images are from the following sources: Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Medical University of Vienna, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Melanoma Institute Australia, University of Queensland, and the University of Athens Medical School.

The dataset was curated for the [SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview) hosted on Kaggle during the Summer of 2020.
