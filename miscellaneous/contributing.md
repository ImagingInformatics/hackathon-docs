## SIIM Hackathon Dataset
We are always in search of volunteers to help enrich our dataset. Below are some ideas for things people can contribute, but we are definitely open to other ideas as well.

* Incorporate non-Radiology sampels (e.g. Dermatology or Pathology) into one of the patient vignette
* Expland the number of featured FHIR resources, e.g. add some `Immunization` or `Medication` resources.
* Enrich existing resources by adding more information, e.g. adding a preliminary report, or an addendum.
* Update our resources for future-proofing against upcoming versions of FHIR
* Incroporate AI-result samples, e.g. DICOM SR TID 1500 and/or FHIR `Observation`
