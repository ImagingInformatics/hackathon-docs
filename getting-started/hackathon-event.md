# 2024 SIIM Hackathon
The SIIM Hackathon returns in 2024 in **hybrid** again, taking place Thursday, June 20th through Saturday June 29th. Everyone is welcome - No coding experience required! The hybrid format allows people to participate 100% virtually but also provides some optional in-person activities at [SIIM 24](https://annualmeeting.siim.org/). More information about the 2024 Hackathon is now available on the [SIIM Hackathon Page](https://siim.org/learning-events/events/hackathon/) - click on the "register" green button on the right-hand side.


The SIIM Hackathon is open to all walks of life, whether you are clinical, technical or something else - we want YOU! In true SIIM spirit, the hackathon is focused on education and collaboration above all else. Come in groups or individually - we can pair you with others. The hackathon is not a full-time engagement, meaning, you can join us with any amount of free time you have.

The SIIM Hackathon features imaging informatics APIs like DICOMweb and FHIR among others, along with an open-source dataset showing how clinical and imaging data integrate. Go to [What's new in 2024](../whats-new/2024.md) to find out new and exciting things happening this year.

## How can I participate?

Go to the [Hackathon page on siim.org]](https://siim.org/learning-events/events/hackathon/) and ensure you are registered for the hackathon via the green registration button on the right-hand side. We'll then get in touch with you to announce upcoming sessions of interest.

Additionally, don't forget to join the conversation on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/siimhackathon/shared_invite/zt-mkk0yn2e-KUqOLi6ETBUQmOffxmcQxA).

You can also take time to familiarize yourself with the [Hackathon Server](./hackathon-server.md) and its APIs. As well as [resources of interest](../apis/other-apis-and-standards.md).


## Questions? Problems?
Seek help by posting a message on Slack in `#general`. During the hackathon event, We have code heroes to help with technical matters in `#code-heroes`, and domain experts to help with clinical workflows and domain knowledge in `#domain-experts`.

If you need help outside the hackathon event or for any other urgent matters please contact [Mohannad Hussain](https://github.com/mohannadhussain) or via `@Mohannad` if you are on the Hackathon Slack space.

## Some things to keep in mind!
* SIIM's hackathon dataset provides **ten** cohesive patient stories that connect the FHIR and DICOMweb resources like a real-life patient would have. Search for patients with last name `SIIM`.
*  Our FHIR server features versions R5 (latest) and R4 of the standard.
* Our DICOMweb server may not support every feature described in the DICOMweb specifications. Check [here](https://hg.orthanc-server.com/orthanc-dicomweb/file/tip/Status.txt) for more details.
