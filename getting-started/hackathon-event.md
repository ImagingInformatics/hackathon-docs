# 2022 SIIM Hackathon
Join the SIIM Hackathon, taking place **virtually** May 31-June 3, 2022. Everyone is welcome - No coding experience required!

The SIIM Hackathon is open to all walks of life, whether you are clinical, technical or something else - we want YOU! In true SIIM spirit, the hackathon is focused on education and collaboration above all else. Come in groups or individually - we can pair you with others. The hackathon is not a full-time engagement, meaning, you can join us with any amount of free time you have.

The SIIM Hackathon features imaging informatics APIs like DICOMweb and FHIR among others, along with an open-source dataset showing how clinical and imaging data integrate. This year's additions including a private Blockchain network for tinkering, as well as Enterprise Imaging (i.e. non-Radiology) DICOM image samples.

## How can I participate?

Go to [https://siim.org/page/hacking_healthcare](https://siim.org/page/hacking_healthcare) and ensure you are regitered for the hackathon sessions like the *kickoff* and *brainstorming* sessions at a bare minimum. At those sessions, we'll help you find you way.

Don't forget to join the conversation on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/siimhackathon/shared_invite/zt-mkk0yn2e-KUqOLi6ETBUQmOffxmcQxA). 

For inspiration of ideas to implement, check this [list of hackathon project ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E8txiKck5jxTEzJ2FadaMKnwJoZNkgYuUUa69sDY9xY/edit?usp=sharing).

You can also take time to familiarize yourself with the [Hackathon Server](./hackathon-server.md) and its APIs. As well as [resources of interest](../apis/other-apis-and-standards.md).


## Questions? Problems?
Seek help by posting a message on Slack in `#general`. During the hackathon event, We have code heroes to help with technical matters in `#code-heroes`, and domain experts to help with clinical workflows and domain knowledge in `#domain-experts`.

If you need help outside the hackathon event or for any other urgent matters please contact [Mohannad Hussain](https://github.com/mohannadhussain) or via `@Mohannad` if you are on the Hackathon Slack space.

## Some things to keep in mind!
* SIIM's hackathon dataset provides five cohesive patient stories that connect the FHIR and DICOMweb resources like a real-life patient would have. Search for patients with last name SIIM.
*  Our FHIR server features version R4 of the standard (latest).
* Our DICOMweb server may not support every feature described in the DICOMweb specifications. Check [here](https://bitbucket.org/sjodogne/orthanc-dicomweb/src/default/Status.txt?fileviewer=file-view-default) for more details.
