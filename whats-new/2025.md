## üí°Ô∏è A New Idea Pitch Form 
The freedom to pick and choose your projects that you know and love at the SIIM hackathon will always be there.

But for those who prefer a more structured approach, or want to browse ideas currently being mulled for this year's hackathon, we have an [idea pitch form](https://forms.gle/NK7AKbVESnG8cLaT9) where you suggest ideas/projects to tackle this year and nominate a team lead (yourself or something else).

If you want to see what projects/ideas have been pitched, you can see the [live results spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aSTRl48tfQJM7wCxa4ME_kj8MT_y6JK_UW5sO6Dfi9U/edit?usp=sharing).
