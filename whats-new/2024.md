# What's new in 2024?

## üìùÔ∏è A [Registration Form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/55e079d9c30c40deb4ae7b6805419804)
Why a registration form?!? SIIM Hackathons have always been a casual experience and it remains so. However, you are highly encouraged to use this [registration form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/55e079d9c30c40deb4ae7b6805419804) for us to reliable disseminate information and annoucements. Help us help you get the most out of your SIIM Hackathon experience!


## üí°Ô∏è A New Idea Pitch Form 
The freedom to pick and choose your projects that you know and love at the SIIM hackathon will always be there.

But for those who prefer a more structured approach, or want to browse ideas currently being mulled for this year's hackathon, we have an [idea pitch form](https://forms.gle/us52mNyxg8o7TtQT9) where you suggest ideas/projects to tackle this year and nominate a team lead (yourself or something else).

If you want to see what projects/ideas have been pitched, you can see the [live results spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/160Ph4t0BxKb1L-Mv_Bq7867yHEXonBxrslgUf-EixmY/edit?usp=sharing).


## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Yet Again, The SIIM Hackathon Dataset is Growing!
* As of February, 2024. We are now up to 10 `Patients` and 54 `ImagingStudy` resources. Thanks to all volunteer & contributors.
* We are working on integrating pathology studies into the dataset (both FHIR and DICOM)
* Additionally, we will be working on updating a subset of our `DiagnosticReport` resources to feature [IHE Interactive Multimedia Report (IMR)](https://profiles.ihe.net/RAD/IMR/volume-1.html) hyperlinks to images.


## üî•Ô∏è FHIR R5 and R4
* We started by improving our compliance with R4, which now resides in a dedicated [GitHub branch](https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/hackathon-dataset/tree/fhir-r4).
* Then, we upgraded the [main GitHub branch](https://github.com/ImagingInformatics/hackathon-dataset/tree/master) to FHIR R5.
* Big thanks to [Mike Ross](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikerossut/) for all his volunteer work on this.
* As of May 2024. Our server is running two instances of HAPI, the default one with R5 and another one with R4. See [Hackathon Server](../getting-started/hackathon-server.md) for more details.


## ü§ñÔ∏è Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLM is the word on everyone's mind, right? Last year we brought you access to OpenAI's GPT (the API behind ChatGPT) v3.5 and v4.0 through a partnership with [MD.ai](https://md.ai/). Those two return this year, but are working on bringing even more. More announcements coming soon here!


## üõ°Ô∏è Social Media Badge (updated for 2024)
We want you to proudly show off your SIIM Hackathon participation and help us spread the word. Please download our [social media badge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V37Cw_uLXv2w2J0XVp3pKqNH5slPbYS_/view?usp=sharing) and use it to boast on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, etc).


## üéâÔ∏è Celebrating 10 Years of SIIM Hackathons
Together as a community, we have achieved a lot over the years. We are very proud of the Hackathon's impact on the industry and are working on a cool inforgraphic to show off some relevant figures. Stay tuned!

## üìëÔ∏è Expanded Docs
We've just added a guide on exporting [DICOM to JPG/PNG](../apis/dicom-to-jpg-png.md) and [FHIR-related Technologies] (../apis/fhircast-and-cds-hooks.md).


## üôåÔ∏è Kept from last year
  * The hybrid format with the longer timelime - it was a hit!
  * E-badges, [yet again](./2022.md)


## üí§Ô∏è Deprecated
  * Nothing yet!
